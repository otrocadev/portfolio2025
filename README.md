This is the repo for my updated porfolio for 2025! This time I have created a more simplified interface that has just the basic information to avoid distractions and have a cleaner look.

## 🛠️ Stack

For this project I wanted to center on an aproach close to the standard web langages and that is why I choosed the ones mentioned below, using only Astro for separing the components and having a smother developing experience.

- 🚀 Astro 5
- 🔥 Native CSS
- 💚 Native JavaScript
