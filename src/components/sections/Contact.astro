      👋 Hi, I’m Ot Roca, a Frontend Developer with a strong interest in
      building modern, scalable, and user-focused web applications. I enjoy
      transforming ideas into well-structured digital products, paying close
      attention to code quality, performance, and user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      🧑🏻‍💻 I am currently studying a Bachelor’s degree in Software Development
      Techniques at UOC (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya), taught entirely in
      English. In addition, I recently completed a Frontend Development bootcamp
      with Angular, where I worked hands-on with real-world projects, and best
      practices in web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      🚀 My main expertise lies in Frontend development, working with
      technologies such as Angular, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and modern UI
      patterns. I also have experience collaborating on Back-End tasks when
      required, which helps me better understand the full development process.
      I’m a proactive developer with a strong focus on continuous learning and
      technical growth. I enjoy tackling new challenges and aim to deliver real
      value from day one, both in individual tasks and team environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      🎯 Currently, I am looking for a Junior Frontend Developer position where
      I can continue improving my skills, contribute to meaningful projects, and
      grow as a software developer with a product-driven mindset. 📩 If you’d
      like to know more about my work or discuss a potential project, feel free
      to get in touch.
